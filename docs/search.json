    "text": "Fiona Jeweler\n\nWelcome!\nThanks for visiting my website! I’m Fiona Jeweler, and I created this site to share a bit about myself, including my academic journey, research projects, and interests beyond the classroom.\nI’m originally from Northern Virginia and am currently completing my Bachelor of Science in Environmental Studies at UC Santa Barbara. I’m passionate about wildlife conservation, sustainable resource management, and understanding human-wildlife interactions.\nRight now, I’m working on a senior thesis that investigates how food waste management at UCSB influences raccoon foraging behavior. You can more about that and other projects I’ve worked on by visiting the Projects page.\nThis site also includes a Courses page outlining what I’ve studied at UCSB and while abroad in Chile and Australia, an Outside the Classroom page featuring my favorite outdoor and travel interests, an About Me section with more detail on my background and experiences, and a Résumé/CV for a quick overview of my academic and professional journey.\nFeel free to explore—and don’t hesitate to contact me!\n\n\nEducation\nB.S. Environmental Studies, with Honors (2025)\nUniversity of California, Santa Barbara\n\n\n\nConnect with me"
