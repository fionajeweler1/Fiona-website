I’m also a Bren Environmental Studies Fellow, participating in a cohort committed to increasing diversity and inclusion in the environmental field.\nIn addition, I work as a worm wrangler with UCSB’s Associated Students Department of Public Worms, where I manage food waste and compost production. It’s been incredibly rewarding to contribute to a closed-loop food system that benefits the campus garden and student food programs.\n\n\n\nWorms in compost from the Department of Public Worms\n\n\nOur finished compost supports the growth of produce like these vibrant tomatoes at UCSB’s Edible Campus Student Farm:\n\n\n\nTomatoes grown with DPW compost at the UCSB Student Farm"

Using camera traps, I tracked raccoon interactions with open, half-open, and closed trash bins over 18 nights. I analyzed interaction frequency across trash types and discussed implications for raccoon learned foraging, health, overall ecology and human-wildlife coexistence on campus. My work also provides recommendations for more sustainable waste management on UCSB’s campus.\nClick here to read my full senior thesis (PDF)\n\n\n\nRaccoons seen on camera trap foraging at open trash can site\n\n\n\nMapping Raccoon-Waste Interactions\nThe interactive map below displays the three trash can monitoring sites from my senior thesis research at UC Santa Barbara. Each site—categorized as “Open,” “Semi-Open,” or “Closed” based on its accessibility to wildlife—is marked by a circle scaled to reflect the number of raccoon interactions captured by camera traps. The map helps visualize how raccoon activity varied spatially in response to differences in trash can design, with far more interactions occurring at the open site.\n\nlibrary(leaflet)\n\n# Data\ntrash_sites &lt;- data.frame(\n  Site = c(\"Open Can\", \"Semi–Open Can\", \"Closed Can\"),\n  Latitude = c(34.41553, 34.412422, 34.412200),\n  Longitude = c(-119.84517, -119.843723, -119.848092),\n  Interactions = c(31, 3, 1)\n)\n\n# Map\ntrash_sites$Color &lt;- c(\"red\", \"orange\", \"blue\")  # open, semi-open, closed\nleaflet(trash_sites) %&gt;%\n  addTiles() %&gt;%\n  addCircleMarkers(\n    ~Longitude, ~Latitude,\n    radius = 10,\n    color = ~Color,\n    fillOpacity = 0.7,\n    label = ~paste(Site, \"&lt;br&gt;\", Interactions, \"interactions\")\n  )"

    "text": "Example Code Project: Chi-Square Test and Visualization\nIn this example, I use R to create a barplot and run a chi-square test on raccoon visit frequencies to different bin types and visualize the results. This simple analysis helped me determine whether raccoons showed a preference among the different trash can designs, data that was useful to me when talking about how waste management influences raccoon behavior.\n\nCode\n\n# Data\nraccoon_data &lt;- data.frame( TrashCanType = c(\"Open\", \"Semi-Open\", \"Closed\"), Interactions = c(31, 3, 1) )\n\n#Load Package\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n#Barplot\nggplot(raccoon_data, \n       aes(\n         x = TrashCanType, \n         y = Interactions, \n         fill = TrashCanType)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") + \n  labs( \n    title = \"Raccoon Interactions by Trash Can Type\", \n    x = \"Trash Can Type\", \n    y = \"Number of Interactions\" ) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Chi-Square Test\nchisq_test &lt;- chisq.test(raccoon_data$Interactions)\n\n\nResults\nThis barplot shows the difference in interactions by trash can type. The open site had 31 interactions, the semi-open had three and the closed has just one.\nThe test compared this observed distribution of raccoon interactions to the expected distribution if raccoons had interacted equally with all three trash can types. Under this null hypothesis, each can type would be expected to have approximately 11.67 interactions (35 total interactions divided evenly across three categories).\nThe chi-square analysis yielded a test statistic of χ²(2, N = 35) = 48.22, with a p-value &lt; 0.0001. This result indicates a highly significant difference between observed and expected values, providing strong evidence that raccoon interactions at each site are not evenly distributed, and that trash can design plays a role in raccoon interaction with food waste."
