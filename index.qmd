# Fiona Jeweler

**Welcome!**\
Thanks for visiting my website! I'm Fiona Jeweler, and I created this site to share a little bit about myself, including my experiences these past 4 years of college and things I enjoy outside of the classroom.

I’m originally from Northern Virginia and am currently completing my B.S. in Environmental Studies at UC Santa Barbara. I'm passionate about wildlife conservation, human-wildlife interactions, and applying data science to ecological research. I love hiking, birding, camping, and exploring new places.

Right now, I’m working on a senior thesis that investigates how food waste management at UCSB influences raccoon foraging behavior. You can learn more about that and other projects I've been involved with on the [Projects](projects.qmd) page!

This site also includes a list of courses I’ve taken at UCSB and while studying abroad in Chile and Australia, as well as a page dedicated to my favorite outdoor and travel activities.
